# bloggr

A simple blog application written using the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) library. The project was inspired by a similar project written in flask as part of the [official tutorial documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/). This project is my first experience applying a python rest API as part of a full-stack project.
